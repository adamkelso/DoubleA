#DoubleA#

When building apps of any kind, there are several times when small conventions end up saving you large amounts of time. Often these conventions, whether they be patterns or just convenient helper methods, can be used in lots of different apps and be just as helpful for every project they are used in. DoubleA is just that.

##Installation##

To install via composer, run the following command in the terminal:

```
composer require adamkelso/double-a
```

##Clarification##

In the same way that you can't build an electronic device using only double a batteries, you can't build an app directly from these components. However, the small convenience components should help out in nearly any app and contain no dependencies.

There's very few components right now, but as more and more small pieces of apps prove to be very useful, I'll make sure to add them. Of course, pull requests are always welcome, if you have a component to add. Here are the guidelines I ask contributors to follow:
 
 1. DoubleA components should be small, usually single piece, components that can be used in basically any application and solve a single problem very well.
 2. Components should include unit tests and pass them. (PHPUnit preferred but PhpSpec, Behat, or any other popular testing framework is fine.)
 3. Documentation should be included that can be added to the wiki. Nobody is expected to be a fantastic technical writer, but without any explanation of situations where the component could be useful or save time, even the most amazing component won't get traction.
